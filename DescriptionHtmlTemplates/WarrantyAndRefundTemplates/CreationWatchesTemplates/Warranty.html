    <li>In the event that your watch requires repair or servicing, send the watch back to us and we will repair
    it and return to you. You pay only for the shipping charges.</li>
    <li>For watches shipped with manufacturer warranty cards:
        <ul>
            <li>If, for any reason your local service center cannot repair the watch, send it to us for servicing. In such
            cases, the two-year extended warranty provided by Creation Watches applies.</li>

            <li>Send us an email and we’ll analyse your issue. If repair is needed, we’ll ask you to take the watch to
            the service center or to send the watch to us; then we’ll service it and return it to you.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>What's covered or not covered by your warranty?
        <ul>
            <li>Your warranty covers the internal mechanism of the watch.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>It does not cover external physical damage, including:    
        <ul>
            <li>Water/moisture damage</li>
            <li>Damage to the watch case or glass</li>
            <li>Missing stones or gems (e.g., from the watch face)</li>
            <li>Damage to the watch bracelet/band or straps</li>
            <li>Damage to the crown/stem or finishes</li>
            <li>Damage to clasps/buckles</li>
            <li>Signs of wear and tear to the watch from normal daily use</li>
            <li>Damage to the battery</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The warranty does not cover damage under conditions that are not in line with specified manufacturer
    guidelines, e.g. defects caused by outside force, improper use, or that exceed water resistance
    guidelines.</li>
    <li>Also, note that damage as a result of having the watch serviced by a third party voids our warranty.
    This is generally easy for our service center to identify and, in such cases, repairs will be charged.
